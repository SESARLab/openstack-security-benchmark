# Openstack-Security-Benchmark (OSB)

 This repository contains controls implementation of a subset of recommendation from paper "An Assessment as a Service solution applied to the OpenStack use case" submitted for IEEE CLOUD 2017.

 In the repository for each recommendation we provide ii) Control flow φ (control.py) and the relative Parameters λ (parameters) associated with the flow’s operations, iii) Environment π (environemtn) requirements if available.

 The available recommendation controls are the following:

 1. [Maintain Time Synchronization Services]
 	- [control.py](https://github.com/SESARLab/openstack-security-benchmark/blob/master/Maintain%20Time%20Synchronization%20Services/control.py)
 	- [parameters](https://github.com/SESARLab/openstack-security-benchmark/tree/master/Maintain%20Time%20Synchronization%20Services/parameters)
 	- [environment](https://github.com/SESARLab/openstack-security-benchmark/tree/master/Maintain%20Time%20Synchronization%20Services/environment)

 2. [Do Not Use or Set Guest Customization Passwords for the User Profile]
 	- [control.py]
 	- [parameters]
 	- [environment]

 3. [Evaluate Cloud Architecture Dependencies]
 	- Control<sub>1</sub>
 	- Control<sub>2</sub>

 4. [Central Directory for Authentication and Authorization for the cloud profile]
 	- [control.py](https://github.com/SESARLab/openstack-security-benchmark/blob/master/Central%20Directory%20for%20Authentication%20and%20Authorization%20for%20the%20cloud%20profile/control.py)
 	- [parameters](https://github.com/SESARLab/openstack-security-benchmark/tree/master/Central%20Directory%20for%20Authentication%20and%20Authorization%20for%20the%20cloud%20profile/parameters)
 	- [environment](https://github.com/SESARLab/openstack-security-benchmark/tree/master/Central%20Directory%20for%20Authentication%20and%20Authorization%20for%20the%20cloud%20profile/environment)

 5. [Control Cinder fixed_key - C<sub>2</sub>]
 	- [control.py](https://github.com/SESARLab/openstack-security-benchmark/blob/master/Example%20-%20Nova%20fixed_key/control.py)
 	- [parameters](https://github.com/SESARLab/openstack-security-benchmark/tree/master/Example%20-%20Nova%20fixed_key/parameters)
 	- [environment](https://github.com/SESARLab/openstack-security-benchmark/tree/master/Example%20-%20Nova%20fixed_key/environment)
