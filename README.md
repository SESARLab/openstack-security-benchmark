# openstack-security-benchmark

 This repository contains controls implementation of a subset of recommendation from paper "An Assessment as a Service solution applied to the OpenStack use case"

 In the following for each property we provide i) ToE t including the target profile, ii) Control flow φ and the relative Parameters λ associated with the flow’s operations, iii) Environment π requirements if available, iv) a discussion on the the results of the evaluations and a remediation when needed. We note that, all the scripts implementing the Controls, Parameters and Environmental settings are available at https: //goo.gl/ji5o3R
